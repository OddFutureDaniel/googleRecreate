## Additional Notes

This was my first project post graduating, taking roughly 15 hours including research and coding.

After recreating the page for a laptop browser I quickly found out about responsive website design and completely restructured my html and css to try and adopt these design practices.

The page isn't completely responsive but adapts well to standard laptop and phone size, scaling smaller than this caused sizing issues that I will do further research on for my next frontend project.
